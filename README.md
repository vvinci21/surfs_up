Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, weâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the `hawaii.sqlite` database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June.

### Results:

The data provided gave us insight that for the months of June and December, our location had a total temperatures of:

### Summary:
